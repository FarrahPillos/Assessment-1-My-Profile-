    <h2 id=“Personal Information”><b><big>Personal Information</big></h2>


	<h3><em>Name:</em><b> Farrah Pillos</b> </h3>
	<h3><em>Student Number:</em> s3882573</h3>
	<h3><em>Email Address:</em> s3882573@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
	<h3><em>Nationality:</em> Filipino and Australian</h3>
	<h3><em>Languages:</em> Tagalog and English</h3>
	<h3><em>About Me</em></h3>

	<p>I came here to Australia to pursue my dream as a nurse. And yes, I got it with 		hard work and perseverance.
	<br/>I am a fulltime nurse, and most of the time, I spend my free time biking around the local area or doing coastal walks.

	<br/> Furthermore, I also love travelling, luckily before the International borders shut due to the pandemic, I was able to travel in Asia and came back here in Australia without any trouble.

	<br/>Also, I am fond of using mobile applications such as maps, social media platforms, and mostly playing online games like Mobile Legends and Among Us with my fiancé and relatives who are overseas.

	<div id="interestInIT">

    <h2 id=“Interest in IT”><center>Interest in IT</center></h2>
	<h3><em>What is your interest in IT?</em></h3>
	<p>My interest in IT sparks because of its constant presence and rapid advancement of technology used in healthcare settings. So having knowledge in IT, I think will give me more advantage not only on how to manipulate the machines used at work but also an advantage to have more choices of job in the future since technology is changing so quickly in healthcare settings. Furthermore, I also want to be involved in developing software that will help healthcare workers, especially nursing staff, make their job easier and efficient while preserving the safety of their patients.
</p>

	<br/>

	<h3><em>When did your interest in IT start?</em></h3>
    <p>My fascination with IT began in my teenage years when my mother bought me my first desktop computer. I started exploring what can be done on the computer. I started playing games, making photo slides and videos. And further, expose me to online games, and create my first social media account. I also met people who work in the IT industry in which they mostly share their work experiences, and find it interesting. In addition, at my young age, I entered a business using my computer like downloading and editing songs into a CD and printing jobs. Moreover, I also try to fix my computer first by searching on the internet about the related problem before seeking a professional computer technician. Hence, I do make sure that I have watched and learnt how the professional technician fixes my computer. </p> <br/>

    <h3><em>Outline your IT Experience (if any)</em></h3>
	<p>My interest in IT was set aside because I was surrounded by healthcare professionals. As a result, I continued studying nursing. Thus, I could say that I do not have a formal IT experience. However, my passion for IT leads me to take this course. </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</em></h3>
	<p>To start my dream to be in IT, choosing a University is crucial. I am looking for an online University that will give me high flexibility while I am juggling work and study. And will be able to give me a strong foundation to jumpstart a career in IT in the future. I have known RMIT University through Open Universities Australia. One of my colleagues referred it to me. Upon thorough research and reviews and with the guidance from RMIT staff, I believe that RMIT is the best choice among the other competitors. </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</em></h3>
	<p>I am expecting during my studies that It will help me build the strongest IT foundation. Furthermore, It will help me develop all the software development skills that are needed, such as becoming excellent in using program languages and other IT infrastructures. Aside from that, I am expecting that I will be able to know the ethics and policies used in the IT world. Also, Improve my teamwork skills so I can collaborate my work with other IT professionals.  </p> <br/>

	<br/>

	<h3><em>The position and what makes this position appealing</em></h3>

	<p>The position is for Software developer. According to US News and world report (2020) for three consecutive years, software developer tops the list as the best job overall. Software developers are the people who implement software solutions by building applications, websites and programs (Skills and Careers 2020). As I am thinking about my IT career, I came up with the idea that I want to work as a software developer. Thus, I came up with this ideal job. This job advertisement was posted through Indeed Australia by the NSW government and looking for an Emeds Applications Specialist (Health Mgr Lvl 3). I have found it interesting because the job is still related to healthcare, and also related to my dream career in IT to be part of developing and improving the software used in the healthcare system. Furthermore, this position will also give me a great experience and a chance to manage the software infrastructure in the hospital.

    </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Skills, qualifications and experiences required</em></h3>
    <p>The main responsibility of the position is to enhance the eMR module to strengthen the current software processing that is currently used in delivering and managing maternity services to the patients. Moreover, the applicant should be a degree holder in Health Information Management, IT, Nursing, Allied Health, Medical or Applied Science and equivalent work experience within a hospital setting. Understanding and experience in developing, managing and supporting Cerner clinical application is also an advantage. Furthermore, an applicant should be a team player with the ability to multitask, good time management and with excellent verbal and written communication.
    </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Skills, qualifications and experiences you currently have</em></h3>
    <p>As I work in a healthcare setting, I think I already have some of the job qualifications. Since I have experience in some of the organisational skills like good time management, working in a team, and being able to multitask. However, they are looking for someone who is excellent in using the Cerner clinical application. Thus I do not have experience of it. As this job pertains to software development, knowledge and ability to use programming languages like Cerner command language used in the Cerner clinical application is a must. Unfortunately, I do not have any experience in using any programming languages at the moment. </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Plan</em></h3>
	<p>To help myself for this ideal job, I need to build my core knowledge in software development. As per Khrupa (2018), there are seven stages of the software development cycle, as follows, planning, feasibility analysis, software design, programming, implementation and integration, and software testing. These skills are not learnt instantly. Hence, it needs time to understand further and lots of practice before being able to implement it. My first step is doing this course to help me build my core skills in IT and lead me to develop my skills in software development, such as using programming languages like Cerner command language and software designs. After finishing the course, I will look for a company that uses Cerner clinical application for an internship and job order until I will be able to achieve the required level of expertise for the desired position of my ideal job.

    <h2><center>Personality Profile</center></h2>
	<p>As a person, my family is my priority. I was brought up by conservative parents and surrounded by lovely sisters. To further know me personally, I did three different types of personality tests online. These are the Myers-Briggs test, Learning style test and Big Five Personality test.
	</p> <br/>
	<h3><b>Myers-Briggs Test</b></h3>
<img src="file:///Users/farrahpillos/Documents/Assessment%201/personality%20test%20result.png" alt=“Myers-briggs result” class=“centre”> <br/>

<img src="file:///Users/farrahpillos/Documents/Assessment%201/personality%20defender.png" alt=“Myers-briggs result” class=“centre”>


	<p>According to the Myer-Briggs test result, I am categorised as a Defender Personality. As a Defender Personality, I tend to become supportive of anyone, especially friends and family. Also, as a defender personality, I have the quality of being enthusiastic, observant with a great imagination. Furthermore, I am also reliable and patient. In addition, to a defender personality, I am considered loyal, hardworking with good practical skills. On the other hand, even though defenders tend to be a hard worker and perceive good practical skills, they are humble and shy and tend to downplay their successes. Also, Defenders are very private and very sensitive. Thus, taking things too personally and repressing their feelings. Defenders' personalities also silently perceive to meet everyone's expectation; as a result, they tend to overload themselves. A Defender's personality also values traditions and history to guide their decisions. Thus, they are considered a bit reluctant to change. Furthermore, Considered as being nice to everyone, Defenders personality are also regarded as too altruistic. In which, they do not bother or disturb other people to receive help even though they are really in trouble because they believe that things will get better soon. </p><br/>

	<h3><b>Big Five Personality Test</b></h3>

<img src="file:///Users/farrahpillos/Documents/Assessment%201/Big%20five%20personality%20test%20result.png" alt=“big five personality result” class=“centre”>
	<p>With regards to the Big Five Personality Test result, it showed that I have a medium characteristic of Agreeableness, Extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience while low characteristics to conscientiousness. The positive outcome of this test is showing that I have a characteristic that is friendly and helpful. I also have a high sense of balance in life, where I find a great balance between ideas and practicality, as a social trait of both introvert and extravert, a great realist and a good problem solver. However, having a low characteristic in conscientiousness, I tend to become more relaxed in life. Where I am a great procrastinator and sometimes put aside tasks and do it in the last minute. </p><br/>

	<h3><b>Learning Style Test</b></h3>
<img src="file:///Users/farrahpillos/Documents/Assessment%201/Learning%20style%20result.png" alt=“Learning Style test result” class=“centre”> <br/>
<img src="file:///Users/farrahpillos/Documents/Assessment%201/Learning%20style%20visual.png" alt=“Learning Style test result” class=“centre”>

	<p>On my third personality test, I took the Learning Style Test. It showed that I am a visual learner with a 45% score, a little bit higher than Tactile 30% and Auditory 25%. As a visual learner, I learn more through reading or seeing photos. I mostly tend to solve problems visually in my mind. Try to understand and remember things through imagination. However, as a visual learner, the test showed that I might find myself having difficulty with spoken directions and easily being distracted by noises.
</p><br/>

	<h3><em>What do the results of the three personality tests mean for me?</em></h3>
	<p>The result of the three personality tests that I have done helps me reflect on myself. Further, It thus elaborates my strengths and weaknesses. As I read the result description of each test, I strongly believe that I perceive most of it. Thus, I have high regard for balance with everything I do in life. And mostly know that I learn more on visualisation. Knowing my strengths and weaknesses will guide me to plan ahead to function effectively in a group project. </p><br/>

	<h3><em>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</em></h3>
	<p>As a team player, I am looking for a group that has good communication through writing or video demonstration. Since I learn more through visualisation, I tend to read more than listening to a call conference. I also want to work with people who are open-minded and with high regards in respecting each other in the team. Further, I am also looking for an excellent team leader who can regularly manage the progress of the team project to make sure every team member is not procrastinating with their task.  </p><br/>

	<h3><em>How should I think this into account when forming a team?

	<div id="projectIdeas">


    <h2><center>Project Ideas</center></h2>
	<h3><em>Overview</em></h3>
	<p>This project will be called "My Medical Chart", it is a Personalised on the go Medical chart of every individual on their smartphones. The target client of this application will be anyone who wants to have access with their medical chart, mostly older people, people with disability and medical personnel. This application will enable medical practitioners and Allied health to edit, upload documents to the patient's medical records anytime. Hence, Medical records will be accessible to all clients. Patient's privacy will be the top priority of this application, without consent from the patient, changes to the application are not allowed.</p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Motivation</em></h3>
	<p>According to Meticulous Research, an expected Compound Annual Growth rate at 13.8% in the healthcare IT market will reach a value of $511 billion between 2017 and 2019 (Dyzma 2020). Furthermore, personal access to medical records is a struggle, costly and time-consuming (Krumholz 2019). In addition, dealing with a patient's medical chart has an associated problem in which patient's medical records are stored across different sectors such as public hospitals, and private general medical practices (Senate Community Affairs Committees). Getting medical information from the patient is sometimes frustrating due to the inability of the patient to remember information. The frustrations of getting information from different locations and sources motivate me to propose this application as well as the predicted increase in the use of technology in the healthcare setting. </p><br/>

	<h3><em>Description</em> </h3>
	<p>The application will be available and downloaded through smartphones and computers. The application will prompt the client to do biometrics, such as facial recognition or a number code. If successful to open the application, the main page of the application will give the reader the main information of the patient such as full name, Birthdate, Age, Height and weight, Allergy, Implants available such as a pacemaker, and major disease of the patient like diabetes. On the top left portion of the page, a button called chart will be available; this will let the reader view the whole medical records of the patient. On the bottom left portion of the page, an emergency button will be available for the patient to press as soon as possible if emergency assistance is needed.

    <br/><br/>Once on the page of the chart, the application will let the viewer select a different category such as Medical History, Medications list, Bloods laboratory result, Imaging results, Clinical visits, Medical Personnel notes, Medical observations like temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and blood sugar logs, and appointment tabs will be available. Upon selecting those buttons, the reader will view from recent logs up to old files. For the medical practitioner or allied health, the application will be available to them to view if they will log in using their company code and employee number. However, medical professionals are not allowed to edit the My Medical Chart without patient consent. In the event, where the medical practitioner needs to update the "My Medical Chart" of a patient, the practitioner must acquire consent from the patient. A medical practitioner will log in to the app with company code and employees identification number. After inputting the company code and employee number, the patient will be prompted with a notification that allows another person to access its My Medical Chart. Once acknowledged, the practitioner will be able to update patient's medical records like uploading imaging results, uploading blood results and write medical instructions to the medical personnel notes tab. Sometimes in times of emergency and the patient is not able to consent the practitioner's ability to edit the My Medical Chart, the option will be given to next of kin to give consent on behalf of the patient. The next of kin will have the power to consent to the health team.
<br/><br/>For the emergency button, after downloading the application, the patient will need to input basic information such as full name, birth date, height and weight. However, there will be an option for the patient wanting to add a next of kin to consent on its behalf accessing the My Medical Chart in case of emergency.
<br/><br/>On the negative part of this application, an increased risk of personal data exploitation might happen if the patient is not careful in securing the app. Secondly, the health care team acts unprofessionally by not following patients' privacy rights. In addition, a possibility to forget the codes. Hence, patients have an option to use biometrics instead.</p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Tools and Technologies
    </em></h3>
	<p>For the tools and software for this application, it needs a computer and smartphones with an internet connection, wifi, and a bluetooth connectivity for transferring and uploading files. It also needs programming languages such as Android SDK, SQL Database, web Server and HTML. Thus, in enabling this application "My Medical Chart" to access Electronic Health Records (EHR) software. Electronic Health Records software is a centralised database used by hospitals and clinics to store medical history, lab results, treatment plans, medications and even patient billing information (The Top 20 Most Popular EMR Software Solutions | Capterra, 2020).  </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Skills Required</em></h3>
	<p>Skills necessary for this project include problem-solving skills, use of different programming languages, excellent skills in time and organisational management, skills in detail and accuracy, teamwork skills and mostly self-development skills (Target Jobs 2020). Moreover, a knowledge of the current security policies implemented by the Australian Government in accessing databases on electronic health records is also needed to operate the project legally. At the time being, my knowledge and skills in Information Technology are far from reality in doing this project. On top of that, the cost of the software and legal processing is not feasible.
   </p> <br/>

	<h3><em>Outcome </em></h3>
	<p>Patients' ability to provide health records anytime will give them fast medical attention in the event they need it the most such as if a patient is overseas or visiting a health facility without a medical record software access. As a health worker, accessing a patient's document in an easy manner will improve the efficiency of giving care to patients. Moreover, medical practitioners will be on track with the patient's current medical status. Thus, enable medical practitioners to provide proper treatment for the patient. This application will benefit both the patient and the healthcare team.
